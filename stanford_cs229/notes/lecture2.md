# Linear Regression
**Supervised Learning Example**
- Imagine a prediction market like housing where you are looking to predict future house prices based on historical time-series data.
- Training data (the historical prices) will be fed into a learning algorithm (our model of future price behavior) which then outputs a hypothesis function H (a method that outputs a prediction of the house price in the future based on some input data).
- The learning algorithm is essential a transformation that can take data from a specific vector space and return a mapping from future input vector spaces to some vector space of ideal values.
