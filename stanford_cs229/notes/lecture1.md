# Machine Learning Definition
First Definition - Arthur Samuel (1959): Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed
Second Definition - Tom Mithell (1998): A computer program is said to learn from experience if some experience E in relation to a task T which is measured by performance P, improves in performance P over experience E.

# Brief History
- Arthur Samuels invented a checkers playing machine that learned by playing against itself.

# Supervised Learning
Example
    - Ultimately all supervised learning is based on prediction based on some x -> y mapping

**Problem Types**
    - RegressionModeling data with a continuous function e.g. x -> x^2
    - Classification
      - Modeling data based on a step function e.g. x -> 0 || 1 or discrete set of output states

**Support Vector Machines**
    - Model that operates in an infinite dimensional space

# Reinforcement Learning
**Definition**
- Reinforcement Learning is a system of rewards and punishments that are used to teach an algorithim how to accomplish a defined task based on some criteria.
- Example: Teaching a dog how to do something.
